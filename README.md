# CT-image-reconstruction
This repository is a collection of experiments I conducted as part of my M.Tech Project. 
CT imaging is a standard inverse imaging problem, where the image is reconstructed using measurements (sinograms). 
Iterative model-driven approaches have become a standard when it comes to CT imaging. However data-driven approaches in recent times have become more desirable for obvious reasons (handcrafting iterative models for different scenarios is quite tedious)
In this project, we've explored several data-driven approaches. Our experiments include the Helsinki tomography challenge and the implementation of FBP ConvNet.
